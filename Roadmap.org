* WereSync Roadmap
** Version 1.0

WereSync's goal for version 1.0 is the following features:

 - [ ] Make drives with LVM bootable
 - [ ] Add builtin plugins for the following bootloaders
   + [ ] Syslinux
   + [ ] LILO
   + [ ] Possibly Grub Legacy (not sure if this is worth it)
 - [ ] Check that most UEFI bootloaders are truly supported by the uuid_copy
       plugin
   + Grub2 confirmed
   + Refind confirmed
 - [ ] Support localization (ideally includes translation, but in either case
   this should support plugin-capabilities)
 - [ ] Run final tests on a variety of setups, ideally with the help of the
   community to check for oddities.
