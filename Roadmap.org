* WereSync Roadmap
** Version 1.0

WereSync's goal for version 1.0 is the following features:

 - [X] Make drives with LVM bootable
 - [X] Add builtin plugins for the following bootloaders
   + [X] Syslinux
   + +[ ] LILO+ Not possible to support by WereSync
 - [ ] Check that most UEFI bootloaders are truly supported by the uuid_copy
       plugin
   + Grub2 confirmed
   + Refind confirmed
 - [X] Support localization (ideally includes translation, but in either case
   this should support plugin-capabilities)
 - [ ] Run final tests on a variety of setups, ideally with the help of the
   community to check for oddities.
 - [X] Confirm that WereSync continues well after a suspension
   + Bonus: check if WereSync can continue well after a hibernation

** Version 1.2

** Future Features

These features are not planned for a specific version yet, and will be moved
when their time comes
