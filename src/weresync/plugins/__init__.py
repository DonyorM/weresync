Bootloader plugin is any class extending
:py:class:`~weresync.plugins.IBootPlugin` inside a file name following the
regex pattern "^weresync_.*\.py$". These plugins can be installed to the
site-packages directory (for example, using pip) or to
/usr/local/weresync/plugins.

For an example plugin see the `GrubPlugin <https://github.com/DonyorM/weresync/blob/master/src/weresync/plugins/weresync_grub2.py>`_.""" # noqa
