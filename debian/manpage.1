.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
WereSync clones linux drives incrementally producing a bootable clone. Clones produced by WereSync will have different UUIDs than the original drive, but WereSync will update the fstab and bootloader to allow the clone to properly boot. Clones can be created with one command or one button click, using \fIweresync\fP or \fIweresync\-gui\fP respectively.
.SS Important
.sp
weresync (both the gui and the command line app) require root access in order
to access block devices. Neither can work without root access.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The \fIweresync\-gui\fP command takes no arguments. These arguments apply to the \fIweresync\fP command.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help
Displays help message.
.TP
.B \-C\fP,\fB  \-\-check\-and\-partition
Checks if all partitions are large enough and formatted correctly to allow drive to be copied. If the partitions are not valid, the target drive will be re\-partitioned and reformatted. If unset, no checking occurs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-source\-mask \fIMASK\fP
A string to be passed to format() that will produce a partition identifier (/dev/sda1 or such) of the source drive when passed two arguments: the identifier ("/dev/sda") and a partition number in that order. Defaults to "{0}{1}"
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-target\-mask \fIMASK\fP
A string to be passed to format() that will produce a partition identifier (/dev/sda1 or such) of the source drive when passed two arguments: the identifier ("/dev/sda") and a partition number in that order. Defaults to "{0}{1}".
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-excluded\-partitions \fILIST\fP
A list of comma separated partition numbers that should not be searched or copied at any time. These partitions will still be formatted if \-C is passed. Defaults to empty.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b\fP,\fB  \-\-break\-on\-error
If passed the program will halt if there are any errors copying. This flag is not recommended because it will halt even if encountering a normal issue, like a swap partition.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-grub\-partition \fIPART_NUM\fP
The partition number that grub should be installed on. It is recommended to pass this always, but it WereSync will attempt to find the main partition even if it is not passed.
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-boot\-partition \fIPART_NUM\fP
The partition that should be mounted on /boot of the grub_partition. If you have a separate boot partition, you must use this flag.
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-efi\-partition \fIPART_NUM\fP
The partition that should be mounted on /boot/efi of the grub_partition. If passed this will create the /boot/efi folder if it does not exist and pass it to grub. Required if you have an EFI partition.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-source\-mount \fIDIR\fP
The directory to mount partitions from the source drive on. Cannot be the same as \-\-target\-mount. If unset, WereSync generates a randomly named directory in the /tmp dir.
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-target\-mount \fIDIR\fP
The directory to mount partitions from the target drive on. Cannot be the same as \-\-source\-mount. If unset, WereSync generates a randomly named directory in the /tmp dir.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-rsync\-args \fIRSYNC_ARGS\fP
The arguments to be passed to the rsync instance used to copy files. Defaults to "\-aAXxH \-\-delete"
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB  \-\-verbose
Makes WereSync increase output and include more minor details.
.TP
.B \-d\fP,\fB  \-\-debug
Causes a huge amount of output, useful for debugging the program. Usually not needed for casual use.
