+        
+        A lone hard drive stands atop a data heap, staring at the full moon. Suddenly, it
+        transforms...into a bootable clone of your drive, whirring hungrily at the digital
+        moon.
+        
+        WereSync takes a Linux hard drive and effectively clones it, but works incrementally
+        so you don't have to spend so long backing up each time. Additionally, WereSync
+        can clone to a smaller drive, if your data will fit on the smaller drive. Because WereSync
+        uses rsync to copy, it can copy a running drive,though certain parts of state may not be
+        preserved.
+        
+        Installation
+        ============
+        
+        WereSync can be installed using the `setup.py` file.
+        
+        .. code-block:: bash
+        
+           $ ./setup.py install
+        
+        If you have `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_ installed, you can easily install WereSync with the following command::
+        
+            $ pip install weresync
+        
+        For more in-depth instructions, see the `installation documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/WereSync/installation.rst>`_.
+        
+        Basic Usage
+        ===========
+        
+        **Note:** WereSync requires root capabilities to run because it has to access block devices.
+        
+        The gui can be launched with the command::
+        
+            $ sudo weresync-gui
+        
+        To see the options for the terminal command use::
+        
+            $ weresync -h
+        
+        To copy from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb (the two drives must have the same partition scheme) use::
+        
+            $ sudo weresync /dev/sda /dev/sdb
+        
+        For more information, including how to copy the partition table from drive to
+        another, see the `Basic Usage <https://pythonhosted.org/WereSync/weresync.html/>`_
+        documentation page.
+
